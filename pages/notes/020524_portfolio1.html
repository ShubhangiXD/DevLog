            Discovered FreeCodeCamps 2D portfolio game website, and it seemed like an awesome way to show off. TBH I am overwhelmed by the sprite sheet, but hey, it's the coding that matters.
            So far, I got the animation sheet down, made a few setup files, nothing much else. But I hope to finish the project in two days, by the time my laptop gets repaired and returned, 
            which is the main reason why the lotus project is being held up. Let's hope it works out. I also made a snake game yesterday (it was copied, but it was for understanding character 
            controls in JS, not a complete waste.) :P
