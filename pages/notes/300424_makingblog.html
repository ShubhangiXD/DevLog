            I was planning on making a blog for the longest time because I get the craziest ideas that I am unable to fulfill due to my lack in skills.
            However, this summer I finally picked up my pace and am currently taking a break from my curriculum to work on game dev. I will post more in the coming days, including 
            updating this blog from time to time, not to mention how far along I get in the game dev process. Hopefully, having the blog will motivate me to work
            more consistently.
